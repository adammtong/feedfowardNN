# feedfowardNN
Implementation of a feedfoward nerual network from scratch in python. Also includes code for visualisation of a 2d decision boundary and the total loss. This is aimed to be a toy function to let the user play with the various hyperparameters such as regularisation, learning rate and momentum and test the impacts.

If you are interested in the derivation of the code - from scratch - see the series of blog posts starting here http://edgeofabandon.blogspot.com.au/2016/11/feedforward-artificial-neural-network.html

The blog posts assume no prior knowledge of neural nets, just an understanding of matrices and the chain rule. 
Happy coding!
